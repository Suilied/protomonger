Prototype Warmonger
Mainly a proof of concept and combination of the following techs/libraries:
- RVO
- Flocking algorythm
- Circlepacker
- Pathfinder

Todo Shortlist:
- move agent "goal" data to agent
- in fact, move all agent data to the agent
- create function that sets the agent goal
- - depending on pathfinder-path
- - is usable by some system that checks if intermediate PF goal has been reached
- debug draw for dot and cross product calculations
- make it so the path tool can be used to asign movement actions to agents
- implement "terrain" for agents to avoid
